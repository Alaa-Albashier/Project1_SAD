In the background study, Manufacturing Company operates within a dynamic and competitive market environment where effective inventory management is pivotal for maintaining operational efficiency and meeting customer expectations. However, the company's current practices, primarily reliant on manual processes and outdated systems, have proven inadequate in addressing the complexities of modern supply chain dynamics.
Currently, the company faces numerous challenges stemming from its inefficient inventory management practices. Chief among these is the lack of real-time visibility into inventory levels and movements. With disparate systems and manual record-keeping methods, accurately tracking inventory across warehouses and production facilities becomes a challenge. This lack of visibility often results in discrepancies between recorded inventory levels and actual stock on hand, leading to frequent stockouts of critical materials and components.
Consequently, the company experiences disruptions in production schedules, with manufacturing processes frequently halted or delayed due to insufficient inventory. These disruptions not only hinder the timely delivery of products to customers but also incur additional costs associated with rush orders, expedited shipping, and overtime labor to compensate for material shortages.

Moreover, the reliance on manual inventory management processes introduces a significant margin for error. Human errors, such as data entry mistakes, miscounts, and discrepancies between inventory records, further exacerbate the challenges faced by Manufacturing Company. These errors not only compromise the accuracy of inventory data but also undermine the company's ability to make informed decisions regarding procurement, production planning, and resource allocation.
In addition to operational inefficiencies, the manual nature of inventory management processes incurs substantial administrative overheads and labor costs. Employees spend valuable time manually updating inventory records, reconciling discrepancies, and performing routine inventory counts, diverting resources away from more value-added activities.
In summary, the background study reveals that Manufacturing Company's current inventory management practices are ill-equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving business landscape. Inefficient manual processes, lack of real-time visibility, disruptions in production schedules, and increased costs collectively underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive solution to modernize and streamline inventory management operations. The EIMS project thus emerges as a strategic imperative to address these challenges and propel the company towards operational excellence and sustainable growth.
Problem Statement: The existing inventory management practices at Manufacturing Company are riddled with inefficiencies and shortcomings that pose significant challenges to the company's operations and competitiveness in the market. The primary issues plaguing the current system can be distilled into several key areas, each contributing to the overall inefficacy of inventory management processes.
First and foremost, the manual nature of inventory management processes gives rise to inefficiencies that impede the company's ability to operate with agility and precision. Manual data entry, paper-based record-keeping, and reliance on spreadsheets for inventory tracking are prone to errors and inaccuracies. These errors not only compromise the accuracy of inventory records but also lead to discrepancies between recorded inventory levels and actual stock on hand. Consequently, decision-making processes related to procurement, production planning, and order fulfillment are hindered by the lack of reliable and up-to-date information.
Furthermore, the absence of real-time visibility into inventory levels and movements exacerbates the challenges faced by Manufacturing Company. With disparate systems and siloed data sources, stakeholders across the organization lack access to timely and accurate information about inventory status across various warehouses and distribution centers. This lack of visibility impedes the company's ability to respond promptly to changes in demand, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize inventory levels to meet customer requirements.
Moreover, the inadequacy of forecasting mechanisms further compounds the challenges associated with inventory management. Without robust forecasting models and algorithms to predict demand patterns accurately, the company struggles to anticipate future inventory requirements and plan procurement and production activities accordingly. As a result, stockouts of critical materials and components are commonplace, leading to disruptions in production schedules, delayed.
